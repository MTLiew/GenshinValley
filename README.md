# Genshin Valley

WORK IN PROGRESS

This project is intended to be a tool to evaluate the artifact substat strength of a character in Genshin Impact.

The primary usage of this tool will be to assist players in determining which character they would like to improve the strength of, relative to the strength of the other characters on their roster.

NOTE: This tool does NOT tell the user which character is the most optimized in terms of their damage; it simply displays and compares the substat roll quality of the artifacts that are presently equipped on various characters.

GenshinValley uses .GOOD, a data format description that maps in-game data into JSON. This data format is used by (and thus, this tool is compatible with,) Genshin Artifact Optimizer and Inventory Kamera.
